  Dialogue:
  - "From your hook, an amalgamation of a creature appeared. Tattered by it\u2019s
    lifelong journey, the creature carries corpses of its adversaries. Some stripped
    to their core, some having it ripped out violently. A faint glimmer reflects
    off its\u2019 spoils of war, treasures coveted, stories untold. It seems you've
    fished this spot dry of its potential bosom-companions."
