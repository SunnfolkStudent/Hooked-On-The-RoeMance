  Dialogue:
  - It seems thou hadst unearthed mine fine form. What parts of the blue wide yonder
    does thou originate from?
  - "Seems you\u2019re quite the superior fellow. Not like the <b>peasants</b> in
    these parts, *spits*."
  Option1:
  - What did you say?
  - Never been a fan of those peons either
  Option2:
  - Mine origins are of the Terra firma domain
  - "That\u2019s not nice!"
  Option3:
  - "I\u2019m from\u2026 the rich parts?"
  - "What\u2019s a peasant?"
  Option4:
  - "I\u2026 originate from my mother!"
  - Working class, am I right?
